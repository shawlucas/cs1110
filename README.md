I attempted to create a replica of the first Super Mario Bros in Python using the PyGame library. Stutters a bit, but I hope to improve this in the future.

I don't have much knowledge in Python, my knowledge is mostly in Assembly and C++, so it was interesting to try to do this in python.

I used textures from https://www.nesfiles.com

Values for velocity and jump positions were gathered from http://www.nesdev.com/
