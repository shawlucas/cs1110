# CS1110

How to Play:

Run:

python3 main.py

Jump is A, Run is S

To start hit enter.

Most of the documentation is in the mario.py and tools.py files. Also check the docs folder.

I attempted to create a replica of the first Super Mario Bros in Python using the PyGame library. Stutters a bit, but I hope to improve this in the future.

I don't have much knowledge in Python, my knowledge is mostly in Assembly and C++, so it was interesting to try to do this in python.

I used textures from https://www.nesfiles.com

Values for velocity and jump positions were gathered from http://www.nesdev.com/

Things to fix:

Running speed spiked when upgrading to python 3.8. I have to look more into how the engine was changed.
Game is not completely smooth.
Mario sometimes gets teleported to the other side of the screen. I'm not sure why.
